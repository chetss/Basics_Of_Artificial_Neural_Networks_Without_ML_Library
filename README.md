# Basics_Of_Artificial_Neural_Networks_Without_ML_Library
You hear the term neural network quite often nowadays. In this repository I have tried to explain basics of the neural network 
and math used in neural networks. For better understanding of the concepts we have taken data of input and output pairs which resembles
XOR gate. Trained the network and calculated the output if the set of input which is not there while training is given. 
I hope you will understand the basics of the neural networks after going through this repository.
